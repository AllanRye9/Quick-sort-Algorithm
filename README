Quick sort is one of the  efficient sorting algorithm due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot is consistently chosen as the smallest or largest element. Despite this, quick sort is widely used in practice and is often favored for its efficiency and simplicity.Quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. The key steps of the algorithm are:

1. **Partitioning:** Choose a pivot element from the array. Rearrange the array elements such that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it. The pivot itself is now in its final sorted position.
2. **Recursion:** Recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays on the left and right sides of the pivot, until the entire array is sorted.
3. **Combination:** Once the sub-arrays are sorted, no additional work is needed to combine them because they are already sorted in place.
